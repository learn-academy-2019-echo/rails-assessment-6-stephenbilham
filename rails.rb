# 1. Create a method called hello_world that takes a language code (e.g. "es", "de", "ru", "ja") as an argument and returns the appropriate version of "Hello, World" for the given language. The default should be English. Test your code with THREE method calls. Expected output for hello_world 'es': 'Hola Mundo', hello_world 'de': 'Hallo Welt'
